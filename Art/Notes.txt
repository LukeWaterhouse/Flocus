1. Shapes:

* don't have jumps too big, for example a line of 5 then a line of 1 then 5 again.
* Guy in the video said to at first avoid the pixel perfect tool, do your own lines and then fix, removing 90 degree angles.

2. Contrast:

* Contrast between background and foreground should be high enough to tell different but not too high.

3. Negative space

* Positive space is what our object is and negative space is what it isn't.

4. Geometric shapes

* everything can be broken down into cube, sphere, cylinder, cone and pyramid. Shading gives the illusion of being 3D

5. Shading

* for spheres, pick a point on either side and exactly match as you move towards the center

6. Dittering

* For creating gradients between two colours

7. Hue

* Hue is one of 3 main properties of a colour, the others being saturation and value, combined you get a colour.
* If you take orange colour and reduce saturation and darken you get brown, but the hue has not changed.
* Hue and colour are not the same.

8. Saturation

* This is the intensity of a colour, as saturation decreases the colour becomes grayer.
* destauration doesn't work by introducing black/white, its by introducing the colour 
on the opposite side of the colour wheel.

9. Value

* How much black or white tint we have in the colour.

10. Colour Harmony

* Analogous colour harmony
* Monochromatic
* Complementary

Regarding complementary colour sometimes the stark contract can be too much, so can nullify this by saturating one of 
the colours, ie introducing some of the complementary colours like orange into blue or vice versa.

For monochromatic must use contrast.

Analogous, is picking a colour on the colour wheel then using the tertiary colours next to it.

11. Creating colour pallete

Hue shifting, when creating shadow and highlight colours must shift hues.
to make shadow in day light put the hue slightly towards blue and darken.
to make lighter in daylight put the hue slightly towards yellow and brighten.

12. RPG View

* directly from top is top down, then there is side view (platformer). Anything between is RPG view, for example 45 degreen angle.
An example is pokemon.
